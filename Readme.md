##About me
I'm a front-end engineer that loves to work with challenging and creative projects. My career started in 2012 and since then I have gained experience everyday. As a programmer I'm in a constantly search for better practices and also experimenting new things.

I love to work and colaborate with teams and I'm good comunicator too. In my spare time I like to teach my friends about something that I've learned.
